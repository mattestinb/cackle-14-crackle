## Description

The project involved creating a CMS-style blog site for developers, similar to WordPress, allowing them to publish posts and comment on others'. Built from scratch and deployed on Heroku, it follows the MVC paradigm. The site uses Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM for database interactions, and the express-session npm package for user authentication. This setup ensures a well-structured, dynamic, and secure platform for developer community engagement.
